# AIIP-Preet-Pannu-Online-Student-Monitoring-App

The idea for this project came from my mother who is a teacher and she often finds it difficult to monitor the class while delivering lessons. At times students do not pay attention and will be distracted looking elsewhere. This application will provide a warning when a student is not paying attention, looking away or indulging in playful acts by using pose recognition technology. The teacher will then immediately know who is not following her in class. This is the objective of my project and this program will be really beneficial to all teachers in monitoring their students and teachers can then devote all their focus on delivery the lessons. Students will also be more cautious and attentive in class.
